## Data

```{r}

students <- read.dta (file = theUrl_ca2a)
```

# II. Potential outcomes

(a) Y(0,i) = asked for risk perception, then recall the last instance of bicycle theft
    Y(1,i) = asked to recall last instance of bicycle theft, then risk perception
    
RC: I think the above is wrong, should be somthing like this:
(a) Define the two potential outcomes for a particular student, Y(0,i) and Y(1,i).
Y(0,i) = Risk perceptions remain the same
T(1,i) = Risk perceptions changes. 

(b) Their perception of bicycle theft could be affected because they were reminded of the last time this happened. This makes the memory more salient, which makes them consider the risk more readily.

# III. Descriptive statistics

```{r}
summary(students)
```

```{r}
summary(students$perception_person_low)
```

```{r}
ggplot(students, aes(x=as.factor(perception_person_low)))+
  geom_histogram(stat="count")+
  labs(x='perception', y='count', title='Perception bicycle theft risk is low')
```

```{r}
summary(is.na(students$perception_person_low))
```

# IV. Balance check

```{r}
ctable(students$treatment, students$female)
```

```{r}
ctable(students$treatment, students$international)
```

```{r}
ctable(students$treatment, students$moved_notrecent)
```

```{r}
ctable(students$treatment, students$age20)
```

```{r}
t.test(students$female~students$treatment)
```

# VI. Statistical power

```{r}
students %>%
  filter(treatment==0) %>%
  summarise(mean=mean(perception_person_low), sd=sd(perception_person_low))
```

```{r}
pwr.t.test(n = NULL, d = 0.2, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8, type = c("two.sample"), alternative="two.sided")
```

```{r}
pwr.t.test(n = 92, d = 0.2, sig.level = 0.05, power = NULL, type = c("two.sample"), alternative="two.sided")
```

# VI. Estimating treatment effect in a randomized trial

(a)
```{r}
students_peek <- students %>% group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(perception_person_low_mean=mean(perception_person_low))
students_peek
```

```{r}
ggplot(students_peek, aes(y=perception_person_low_mean, x=as.factor(treatment))) + geom_bar(stat='identity', fill='darkblue') + labs(x='Treatment', y='share with low perceived theft risk', title='Having a low perceived theft risk by treatment status')
```

The graph suggests that the control group has more people with a low perception of theft risk.

(b) Y = a + B*treatment + e
RC: should be like this (b) perception_persons_low = Beta_{0} + /beta_{1}*Treatment + error

(c)
```{r}
reg1 <- lm(perception_person_low ~ treatment, data=students)
summ(reg1, confint=TRUE)
```

```{r}
treatment_effect <- c("Treatment_effect"="treatment")
plot_summs(reg1, scale = TRUE, coefs = treatment_effect, plot.distributions = TRUE)
```

(d) Yes. The regression shows that p = 0.03, so we can reject the null hypothesis at 5% confidence level.
RC: you should never report the p value - it should say.
Yes, the treatment has a statistically significant effect on the outcome variable at a 5% confidence level.



(e) The regression results suggest a lower perception of bicycle theft for those who were reminded of bicycle theft as compared to those who were not.

(f) One can check this the following way: (Estimated treatment effect) / (baseline mean of outcome variable) * 100%. In this case: -0.15/0.2525253*100% = -59.4%. Thus, the treatment effect seems to be rather large.

(g) R^2 in the regression is 0.02, so the size seems to be appropriate

(h) No, because the random selection into control/treatment accounted for this (control also has people who have never had their bike stolen).
